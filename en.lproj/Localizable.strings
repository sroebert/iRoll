	<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\">Goal</h3>
	<p style=\"margin-top:5px;\">The main goal of the game is to roll the dice and acquire specific combinations in order
		to get the highest possible score</p>
	<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\">Summary</h3>
	<p style=\"margin-top:5px;\">Each turn the player can roll the dice 3 times. For the first roll, the player must 
		roll all 5 dice. For turns 2 and 3, the player can decide to roll all dice or a 
		subset instead (while keeping the ones you do not roll).</p>
	<p style=\"margin-top:5px;\">At any time after the first roll, you can fill in a score for a specific combination, 
		which will be explained in the next section. After 3 rolls a player must fill in a 
		score and end his/her turn, after which the next player will roll the dice. This 
		pattern continues until all scores have been filled in. If a player can not fill in any score, the player
		must fill in 0 for an open score of his/her choice. Obviously, the player with 
		the highest score will win the game.</p>
	<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\">Scores</h3>
	<p style=\"margin-top:5px;\">The upper section of the scores contain categories for each possible die face, so in 
		total there are six categories. The score for each category is simply the number of 
		dice rolled with this particular face times the value of the face. So for example, 
		rolling 3-4-5-3-3 will give you a score of 9 in the Threes category.</p>
	<p style=\"margin-top:5px;\">The lower section consists of seven different categories:
	<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle; padding-left:17px;\">
		<li><em>Three of a Kind</em>: At least three dice of the same face. The score is the sum of 
			all dice.</li>
		<li><em>Four of a Kind</em>: At least four dice of the same face. The score is the sum of 
			all dice.</li>
		<li><em>Full House</em>: Three dice with the same face, plus two dice with the same face. The 
			score is 25.</li>
		<li><em>Small Straight</em>: Four sequential dice. The score is 30.</li>
		<li><em>Large Straight</em>: Five sequential dice. The score is 40.</li>
		<li><em>Five of a Kind</em>: All dice have the same face. The score is 50.</li>
		<li><em>Chance</em>: Any combination. The score is the sum of all dice.</li>
	</ul></p>

		It is build as a project for the course Game Programming in the Master degree 
		Intelligent Systems at the University of Amsterdam.</p>
	<p style=\margin-top:5px;\>This is my first iPhone program. I have had experience with many different 
		programming languages, but never before worked with Objective C. I want to 
		thank Standford University, mainly Alan Cannistraro and Josh Shaffer, for creating 
		great

		lectures this application would be far from complete.</p>
